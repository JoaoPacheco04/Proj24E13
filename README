# ♻️ Waste Management System

A Java-based desktop application developed to streamline the lifecycle of waste collection and disposal. This project was built with a strong focus on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to ensure code modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

## 🚀 Core Functionalities

- **Client Lifecycle Management:** Full CRUD operations for managing residential and commercial clients.
- **Smart Scheduling:** Automated logic for scheduling and tracking waste collection tasks.
- **Dynamic Reporting:** Generation of detailed reports regarding system status, collection efficiency, and waste volume.
- **Resource Control:** Monitoring and classification of different waste types to optimize disposal routes.

## 🧪 OOP Principles Applied

This project serves as a practical implementation of key software engineering concepts:
- **Encapsulation:** Ensuring data integrity through controlled access to object states.
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism:** Optimized code reuse for different types of waste and client categories.
- **Abstraction:** Use of interfaces or abstract classes to decouple business logic from implementation.
- **Data Persistence:** Robust handling of data structures (Collections/Lists) for real-time system management.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java (JDK 17+)
- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Tools:** Developed using Eclipse/IntelliJ, managed with standard Java libraries.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The source code is organized into logical packages to follow clean code practices:
- `Projeto`: Contains the core domain models (`Cliente`, `Coletas`, `Residuos`).
- `Logic`: Handles the business rules and report generation (`Relatorio`, `GereResiduos`).
- `Test`: Entry point for system validation and simulation.

## 🔧 Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Run `Teste.java` to launch the system simulation.
